# Ga
This project was generated with NPM.

## Start Application.
Just open index.html

## Install
No need to install this repository, I just ran `npm install` to add the  dependencies when I started working.

## Sass compiler
As the dependencies, I used Sass to compile Bootstrap. If you want you can run `sass assets/sass/index.scss assets/css/index.css` at the root of this project. But only  if you want to generate the css styles.

## Testing with Express server
The email subscription can be test with a small application I did.
You can clone this repository in a folder: https://github.com/pablosamela/ga-server

Run `node server.js` en la misma carpeta.
