This project was generated with NPM.

Just open index.html. 

## Install
No need to intall in this repository, just run `npm install` to add dependencies to start working.

## Sass compiler
As the dependencies, I used Sass to compile Bootstrap. If you want you can run `sass assets/sass/index.scss assets/css/index.css` at the root of this project. But only  if you want to generate the css styles.
